             Implementation notes:
             
             Used for symmetric except when other isn't a HashSet. This is more tedious because 
             other may contain duplicates. HashSet technique could fail in these situations:
             1. Other has a duplicate that's not in this: HashSet technique would add then 
             remove it.
             2. Other has a duplicate that's in this: HashSet technique would remove then add it
             back.
             In general, its presence would be toggled each time it appears in other. 
             
             This technique uses bit marking to indicate whether to add/remove the item. If already
             present in collection, it will get marked for deletion. If added from other, it will
             get marked as something not to remove.

            Determines counts that can be used to determine equality, subset, and superset. This
            is only used when other is an IEnumerable and not a HashSet. If other is a HashSet
            these properties can be checked faster without use of marking because we can assume 
            other has no duplicates.
            
            The following count checks are performed by callers:
            1. Equals: checks if unfoundCount = 0 and uniqueFoundCount = m_count; i.e. everything 
            in other is in this and everything in this is in other
            2. Subset: checks if unfoundCount >= 0 and uniqueFoundCount = m_count; i.e. other may
            have elements not in this and everything in this is in other
            3. Proper subset: checks if unfoundCount > 0 and uniqueFoundCount = m_count; i.e
            other must have at least one element not in this and everything in this is in other
            4. Proper superset: checks if unfound count = 0 and uniqueFoundCount strictly less
            than m_count; i.e. everything in other was in this and this had at least one element
            not contained in other.
            
            An earlier implementation used delegates to perform these checks rather than returning
            an ElementCount struct; however this was changed due to the perf overhead of delegates.

            <summary>
            This works similar to HashSet's CheckUniqueAndUnfound (description below), except that the bit
            array maps differently than in the HashSet. We can only use this for the bulk boolean checks.
            
            Determines counts that can be used to determine equality, subset, and superset. This
            is only used when other is an IEnumerable and not a HashSet. If other is a HashSet
            these properties can be checked faster without use of marking because we can assume 
            other has no duplicates.
            
            The following count checks are performed by callers:
            1. Equals: checks if unfoundCount = 0 and uniqueFoundCount = Count; i.e. everything 
            in other is in this and everything in this is in other
            2. Subset: checks if unfoundCount >= 0 and uniqueFoundCount = Count; i.e. other may
            have elements not in this and everything in this is in other
            3. Proper subset: checks if unfoundCount > 0 and uniqueFoundCount = Count; i.e
            other must have at least one element not in this and everything in this is in other
            4. Proper superset: checks if unfound count = 0 and uniqueFoundCount strictly less
            than Count; i.e. everything in other was in this and this had at least one element
            not contained in other.
            
            An earlier implementation used delegates to perform these checks rather than returning
            an ElementCount struct; however this was changed due to the perf overhead of delegates.
